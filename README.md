total WIP on a roguelike i was making in flash years ago.

leaving it here for you.

Features a flexible maze generation algorithm that produces 'hand designed' random maps, in the vein of Spelunky.
You'll find a (very crude) map editor that lets you design rooms that you can save as xml.
game loads room & map data from xml files

kind of a cool side project built around some neat ideas, but it was bogged down by some major architectural deficiencies I didn't have the expertise to address at the time.  

dunno if I'll ever pick this codebase up again, so buyer beware.  i can try to answer any questions you may have, but please don't expect a full suite of tech support :)
